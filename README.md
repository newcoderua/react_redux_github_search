•What	do	you	like	about	your	solution
  First of all, it works :) Also I used React	Redux	boilerplate:https://redux-minimal.js.org, which time-saver for projects like this.
  I used ES6 features, plus I used descriptive names for functions and variables. I tried to make it as easy as possible, so other developers can understand my code.
•What	do	you	dislike	about	your	solution?
  I need to structure css folder better, add reset_css file. I am using a jquery in this project, that's why I might experience some problems with outdated browsers(Mozilla, Firefox 1.0.x, Internet Explorer 1.0-5.x, Safari 1.0-2.0.1, Opera 1.0-9.x, Konqueror).
•If	you	had	a	full	day	more	to	work	on	this,	what	would	you	improve?
  First of all, I would use bootstrap instead of pure css. Plus I would work on error catching, for example, if I exceed number of requests to github (limit is 30 per minute), app should not work - I would fix that.
  Also I need to fix a bug, when you use up arrow button -> cursor moves to the start of input's value.
•If	you	would	start	from	scratch	now,	what	would	you do differently?
  I would definitely use React Redux boilerplate. Including all problems I described before, I also would decompose my react components into smaller ones.
